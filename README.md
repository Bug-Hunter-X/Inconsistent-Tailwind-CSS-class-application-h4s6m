# Inconsistent Tailwind CSS Class Application

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not applied consistently, even when the syntax appears correct.

## Bug Description

A hover effect using Tailwind CSS classes is not working as expected.  The `hover:bg-blue-700` class should change the background color on hover, but it doesn't.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe that the hover effect is not working.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying that the Tailwind CSS configuration is correctly set up and that the CSS is being properly included in the project.  Ensure your `tailwind.config.js` includes the correct paths and that the `@tailwind` directives are present in your CSS file.
